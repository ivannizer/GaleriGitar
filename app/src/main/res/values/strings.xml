The GK Pro is the ultimate nylon string guitar for professional musicians. Completely solid, with European spruce top, cypress back and sides, equipped with a soft cutaway and Fishman PreFix ProBlend preamp. For flamenco players this model has the typical bright and swinging tone. The GK Pro was designed with a slightly thinner body depth, neck and saddle width than a traditional Spanish guitar and is extremely comfortable and easy to play. The neck is designed to have little or no relief and offers low action and flamenco-like humming, and its Spanish heel provides maximum resonance and projection. It comes in a humidified archtop case from Cordoba.

PRS Guitars recently managed to purchase a load of Curly Maple Tops from a tree population that bordered an old cemetery in the eastern United States. The oldest tombstones there are from 1884 and the trees were at least as old as the first branches started about 13 meters above the ground. The trees were felled in 2017 and Paul Reed Smith says the tops look like what left the Parsons Street plant in Kalamazoo in 1959.

The most successful Fender Custom Shop products are the instruments from the Time Machine Series. Here you can find replicas of the guitars and basses, that made Fender legendary in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Depending on your taste, the instruments are optically aligned to their various vintage conditions. Relics look as if they had all the rigors of tour life subjected to them for years and accordingly show their many \"scars\". Closet Classics on the other hand represent instruments that have been treated more carefully and their age can be detected only because of paint cracks and minor flaws. NOS (New Old Stock) instruments are - if they were real - the dream of every collector. Like being untouched over the years still in original factory condition, so as new but also old.
Most Custom Shop instruments are \"team built\", which means that the guitar is built by a small team of 5 specialists. Each of these teams is headed by a masterbuilder, one of those grandmasters of wood who spend the bigger part of their time building so-called \"masterbuilt\" instruments, where the masterbuilder and he alone does all the work from scratch.
If you cannot find your dream Fender guitar in our range - no problem! Let the Custom Shop build it for you. This does not necessarily need to be more expensive than a regular custom shop instrument but will meet all your individual needs. Talk to us and we'll tell you what is possible…and for which price.

Gibson Custom Shop
The Gibson Custom Shop was founded in 1993 with only five employees. Initially the purpose was to take care of individual orders, the endorser and special models. The Custom Shop's first spectacular action was the revision of the '59 and '60 Les Paul Flametop Reissues. A lot of changes were to be made, to make the reissue as authentic and close to the old originals as possible. Today around 80 experts are working at the Custom Shop, who cover all areas ranging from \"one-off\" instruments to limited runs and RnD. Serial number	6 8258

Franz Bassguitars Wega
This small, but fine bass smithy is based in beautiful Upper Franconia, Germany. Starting as a traditional third generation carpenters workshop, owner Xaver Tremel one day held a bass in his hands and that was it. him. From then on he decided not only to build tables, chairs and benches for the surroundings like his grandfather Josef had done in the past, but also to get into the art of (bass) guitar building.
Years later the results are remarkable: meticulously crafted individual items, handbuilt by master craftsmen. The wood used is predominantly regional, such as alder from the Black Forest or resin and oak from the Spessart, which, in addition to the beautiful and important aspect of the sustainability of raw materials, not only provides a beautiful local touch, but also fits perfectly into this particular bass construction and sound concept.
The Merak series is the Upper Franconian interpretation of a lively 4-string with direct, bony tone and lots of attack. Paired with a beautiful neck, PJ-assembly and excellent workmanship, these instruments are a lot of fun.
